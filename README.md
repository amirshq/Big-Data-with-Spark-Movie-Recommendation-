## Introduction

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation Big Data Project using PySpark! This project aims to provide a collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system using PySpark. Collaborative filtering is a common technique in recommendation systems that suggests items (in this case, movies) based on the preferences and behaviors of users.

In this project, we leverage the power of PySpark, a fast and powerful cluster-computing framework, to process and analyze large-scale movie data and provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (>= 3.x)
- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) (>= 2.x) with PySpark
- [Dataset](link_to_your_dataset) (such as MovieLens dataset)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-pyspark.git
cd movie-recommendation-pyspark
```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use a virtual environment if desired:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Make sure you have the dataset available. If not, download it and place it in the appropriate directory.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset using PySpark to clean, transform, and prepare the data for recommendation.

3. **Model Building**: Build collaborative filtering models using PySpark's MLlib. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best-performing model.

4. **Recommendation Generation**: Use the trained model to generate movie recommendations for users.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of your recommendation system using appropriate metrics like RMSE or precision-recall.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Placeholder for your dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, model creation, and recommendation generation.
- `utils/`: Utility functions or scripts.

## Contributing
